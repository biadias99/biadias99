<h1>Hey! Welcome to my GitHub repository</h1>

<h3>Hey! My name is Bianca but you can totally call me Bia!</h3>

I have a degree at Information Systems (UNESP), currently pursuing an MBA in Software Engineer (USP) and I love to code, especially in JavaScript! I also love to help another people.

Trying to give my best in every project and place I am part of.

<h4>I would love to know more about you! Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.</h4>
